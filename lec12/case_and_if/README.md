# Case and If Comparisons

The folders in this directory mirror what is presented in the lecture slides.  You are
advised to review the folders in the below order, following along with the slides.

1. To start, we look at the [simple](simple) `case` vs `if` comparisons that can be done
   to print out either `0`, `1`, or `2` *blarghs*.
2. Next, we look at how we can adapt these to use our POSIX sets, increasing the support
   for `0..9` *blarghs*.  These can be found in the [sets](sets) directory.
3. We end with how to wield [*extended regular expressions*](eregex) in `if` statements,
   the lecture slides note the limitations of this comparison.
